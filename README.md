# CodelyTV Gilded Rose kata solution

## Introduction

Solution proposal for the Gilded Rose kata.

Restrictions taken into account:
* We can't modify the `Item` class even through inheritance or wrappers. All the algorithm in order to update the items should be contained inside the `GildedRose` class.  

## How To Start

1. Install Java 8
2. Clone this repository `git clone https://bitbucket.org/codelytv/gildedrose`.
3. Run the tests with `./gradlew test`
4. Start refactoring!
